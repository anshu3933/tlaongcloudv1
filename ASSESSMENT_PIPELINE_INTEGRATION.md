# Assessment Pipeline Integration Documentation

## Decision Summary

**Date**: January 8, 2025  
**Decision**: Unified Assessment Pipeline with Special Education Service  
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED  

### Background

The assessment pipeline was originally designed as a separate microservice to handle psychoeducational assessment document processing, score extraction, and quantification. However, architectural conflicts and environment configuration issues led to the decision to integrate it directly into the Special Education Service.

## Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

### Problem Statement

The standalone assessment pipeline service encountered several critical issues:

1. **Environment Variable Conflicts**: Assessment service couldn't load required configuration
2. **Database Connection Issues**: Shared database access created circular dependencies
3. **Service Communication Complexity**: Cross-service calls added unnecessary latency
4. **Deployment Complexity**: Multiple services with shared dependencies

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Separate Microservices (Original Design)
```
Assessment Service (Port 8006) → API → Special Education Service (Port 8005)
                ↓                              ↓
        Separate Database            Shared PostgreSQL Database
```
**Pros**: Service isolation, independent scaling  
**Cons**: Complex configuration, dependency management, higher latency  
**Verdict**: ❌ Abandoned due to configuration conflicts

#### Option 2: Unified Service Architecture (Selected)
```
Special Education Service (Port 8005)
├── Student Management APIs
├── IEP Management APIs
├── Template Management APIs
└── Assessment Pipeline APIs (Integrated)
    ├── Document Processing
    ├── Score Extraction
    ├── Quantification Engine
    └── RAG Integration
```
**Pros**: Simple configuration, shared database, lower latency, easier deployment  
**Cons**: Less service isolation, single point of failure  
**Verdict**: ✅ SELECTED

#### Option 3: Containerized Microservices
```
Docker Compose with proper service isolation and shared environment
```
**Pros**: Production-ready, scalable  
**Cons**: Infrastructure complexity, longer implementation time  
**Verdict**: 🔄 Future consideration

### Decision Rationale

The unified architecture was selected because:

1. **Immediate Functionality**: Eliminates configuration conflicts and enables immediate operation
2. **Shared Data Model**: Assessment models already integrated into shared database
3. **Simplified Deployment**: Single service reduces operational complexity
4. **Performance**: Eliminates network calls between assessment and IEP generation
5. **Development Velocity**: Faster iteration and debugging

## Implementation Details

### Database Integration

**Assessment Models Added to Special Education Database**:
```sql
-- New tables integrated into shared database
assessment_documents          -- Document upload and metadata
psychoed_scores              -- Individual test scores
extracted_assessment_data    -- Raw Document AI output
quantified_assessment_data   -- Processed PLOP-ready data
```

**Relationships Established**:
```python
# Student model extended with assessment relationships
class Student(Base):
    assessment_documents = relationship("AssessmentDocument", back_populates="student")
    quantified_assessments = relationship("QuantifiedAssessmentData", back_populates="student")
```

### API Integration

**Assessment Endpoints Added to Special Education Service**:
```
POST /api/v1/assessments/upload                    # Document upload
POST /api/v1/assessments/process                   # Document AI processing
POST /api/v1/assessments/quantify                  # Score quantification
POST /api/v1/assessments/pipeline/execute-complete # End-to-end pipeline
GET  /api/v1/assessments/student/{id}              # Student assessments
GET  /api/v1/assessments/quantified/{id}           # Quantified data
```

### Service Architecture

**Unified Service Structure**:
```

├── src/
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── special_education_models.py    # Includes assessment models
│   ├── routers/
│   │   ├── student_routes.py
│   │   ├── iep_routes.py
│   │   ├── template_routes.py
│   │   └── assessment_routes.py           # NEW: Assessment pipeline APIs

```

## Technical Benefits

### 1. Configuration Simplification
- **Before**: Complex environment variable management across services
- **After**: Single configuration file, shared environment variables

### 2. Database Consistency
- **Before**: Separate services with potential data inconsistency
- **After**: Single database with ACID transactions across all operations

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **Before**: HTTP calls between assessment and IEP services
- **After**: Direct function calls within same process

### 4. Error Handling
- **Before**: Distributed error handling across services
- **After**: Centralized error handling and logging

## Feature Integration

### Assessment-Enhanced IEP Generation

**New Capability**: RAG IEPs can now use real psychoeducational assessment data
```python
# Direct integration flow
upload_assessment() → process_with_document_ai() → quantify_scores() → generate_rag_iep()
```

**Assessment Data in RAG Context**:
```json
{
  "cognitive_composite": 45.0,
  "academic_composite": 35.0,
  "standardized_plop": {
    "reading": {"current_level": 2.5, "needs": ["comprehension", "fluency"]},
    "math": {"current_level": 3.2, "needs": ["problem_solving"]}
  },
  "priority_goals": [
    {"area": "reading", "priority_level": "high"}
  ]
}
```

### Document AI Integration

**Google Document AI Configuration**:
- **Project ID**: 518395328285
- **Processor ID**: 8ea662491b6ff80d
- **Supported Formats**: PDF psychoeducational reports
- **Extraction Confidence**: 76-98% for standardized test scores

**Supported Assessment Types**:
- WISC-V (Cognitive Assessment)
- WIAT-IV (Academic Achievement)
- BASC-3 (Behavioral Assessment)
- BRIEF-2 (Executive Function)
- And 8+ additional standardized assessments

## Migration Impact

### What Changed
1. **Removed**: Standalone assessment pipeline service (Port 8006)
2. **Added**: Assessment endpoints to Special Education Service (Port 8005)
3. **Integrated**: Assessment models into shared database
4. **Enhanced**: RAG IEP generation with real assessment data

### What Stayed the Same
1. **Frontend Integration**: Same API endpoints (updated URLs)
2. **RAG Functionality**: Enhanced but compatible
3. **Database Schema**: Student/IEP models unchanged
4. **Document AI**: Same processing capabilities

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Testing
```bash
# Test complete assessment pipeline

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "student_id": "c6f74363-c1fb-4b0f-bd6b-0ae5c8a6f826",
    "assessment_documents": [{
      "file_name": "wisc_v_report.pdf",
      "assessment_type": "WISC-V"
    }],
    "generate_iep": true
  }'
```

### Performance Testing
- **Document Processing**: < 30 seconds per document
