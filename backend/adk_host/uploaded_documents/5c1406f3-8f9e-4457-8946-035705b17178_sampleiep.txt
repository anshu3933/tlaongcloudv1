Individualized Education Program (IEP) - Sample
STUDENT: [Student Name] DATE OF IEP MEETING: October 5, 2023 IEP DURATION: October 5, 2023 - October 4, 2024 GRADE: 7 PRIMARY ELIGIBILITY: Specific Learning Disability (Dyslexia)
Part 1: Present Levels of Academic Achievement and Functional Performance (PLAAFP)
Student Strengths, Interests, and Preferences: [Student Name] is a creative and articulate 7th-grader who excels in verbal discussions and demonstrates strong critical thinking skills in science and social studies when information is presented orally. They have a passion for history and enjoy building complex models and participating in hands-on science experiments. [Student Name] has a good sense of humor and is a loyal friend to their peers.
Parent/Guardian Input: [Student Name]'s parents are supportive and actively involved. They report that homework, particularly tasks involving significant reading and writing, is a source of frustration and can take several hours to complete. They are concerned about [Student Name]'s self-esteem and growing anxiety around school. They would like to see their child become a more confident and independent learner and advocate for their own needs.
Academic Performance:
    • General: [Student Name]'s academic performance is impacted by a specific learning disability in reading (dyslexia). This primarily affects their ability to decode words, read fluently, and spell accurately. Their listening comprehension is a significant strength and is at or above grade level.
    • Reading: Based on the Woodcock-Johnson IV assessment (administered August 2023), [Student Name]'s Basic Reading Skills are in the 15th percentile, and Reading Fluency is in the 10th percentile. They struggle to decode multi-syllable words and often substitute or omit words when reading aloud. This slow, laborious reading process significantly impacts their ability to comprehend grade-level texts efficiently. When text is read aloud to them, their Reading Comprehension score is in the 75th percentile.
    • Writing: [Student Name]'s writing is characterized by numerous spelling errors (phonetic spelling is common), inconsistent punctuation, and challenges with sentence structure. The content of their writing shows creative ideas and a good vocabulary, but the mechanics of writing are very difficult. They struggle to organize their thoughts on paper and often produce written work that is brief and does not reflect the depth of their knowledge.
Functional Performance: In the classroom, [Student Name] is hesitant to read aloud or answer questions that require reading from the board or a textbook. They are well-behaved but can appear disengaged during independent reading or writing tasks. They have difficulty with organization, often losing track of assignments and materials. Socially, [Student Name] is well-liked but has expressed feelings of "being dumb" compared to their peers, indicating a need for support in self-advocacy and understanding their learning profile.
Part 2: Measurable Annual Goals
    1. Reading Fluency & Decoding: By October 2024, when given an unfamiliar grade-level passage, [Student Name] will read aloud at a rate of 110 words correct per minute (WCPM) with at least 95% accuracy, as measured by three separate curriculum-based assessments.
        ◦ Baseline: Currently reads at 75 WCPM with 88% accuracy.
    2. Reading Comprehension: By October 2024, after independently reading a grade-level non-fiction text, [Student Name] will be able to answer 4 out of 5 inferential comprehension questions and provide a two-to-three sentence summary of the main idea, as measured by teacher-created assessments and work samples.
        ◦ Baseline: Can answer 1-2 inferential questions and requires significant prompting to provide a summary.
    3. Written Expression: By October 2024, [Student Name] will write a multi-paragraph essay (at least 3 paragraphs) that includes a clear topic sentence in each paragraph, uses appropriate transition words, and demonstrates a 50% reduction in spelling errors through the consistent use of assistive technology (e.g., speech-to-text and spell check), as measured by a portfolio of written work.
        ◦ Baseline: Writes single paragraphs with multiple spelling errors and limited organization.
    4. Self-Advocacy: By October 2024, [Student Name] will independently identify and request at least two specific accommodations (e.g., "May I use text-to-speech for this chapter?" or "Could I have extra time for this assignment?") in their general education classes each week, as documented by a student-teacher weekly check-in log.
        ◦ Baseline: Does not currently request accommodations and relies on the teacher to initiate them.
