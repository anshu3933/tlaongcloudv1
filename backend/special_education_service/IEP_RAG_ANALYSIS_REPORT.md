   - Validate quality of retrieved examples
   - Assess relevance of generated content

3. **Process GCS Documents**
   - Add the 9 synthetic assessment reports
   - Include relevant assessment documents
   - Expand vector store content diversity

### Medium-Term Enhancements

4. **Content Expansion**
   - Add IEPs for different disability categories
   - Include various grade levels (K-12)
   - Add transition-focused IEPs for older students

5. **Quality Assurance**
   - Implement content validation checks
   - Add duplicate detection
   - Monitor generation quality metrics
