## üîÑ PHASE 1 - IMMEDIATE FIXES (Medium Priority)

### API & Validation Issues
- [ ] **Fix remaining API validation issues** (422 errors for disability-types and student search endpoints)
- [ ] **Resolve user authentication integration warnings** (user adapter connection failures)
- [ ] **Add comprehensive error handling** and input validation for all endpoints

---

## üöÄ PHASE 2 - ADVANCED FEATURES VALIDATION & ENHANCEMENT (High Priority)

### RAG System Testing & Optimization
- [ ] **Test and validate existing RAG-powered IEP generation endpoints** (`/api/v1/ieps/advanced/*`)
- [ ] **Populate vector store** with sample IEP templates and examples for better RAG performance
- [ ] **Enhance IEP templates management system** with more comprehensive template library
- [ ] **Implement present levels assessment system** with automated analysis and recommendations
- [ ] **Add IEP workflow management** (approval process, review cycles, notifications)

---

## üîê PHASE 3 - PRODUCTION READINESS (High Priority)

### Security & Integration
- [ ] **Integrate with external authentication service** for production user management
- [ ] **Implement role-based access control** (teachers, administrators, case managers)
- [ ] **Add audit logging and compliance tracking** for IDEA requirements
- [ ] **Create data migration scripts** for production deployment

---

## üéØ PHASE 4 - DEPLOYMENT & MONITORING (Medium Priority)

### Testing & Operations
- [ ] **Implement comprehensive test suite** (unit, integration, end-to-end tests)
- [ ] **Add performance monitoring and observability** (metrics, logging, health checks)
- [ ] **Configure production deployment** with PostgreSQL and proper scaling
- [ ] **Create API documentation and user guides** for production use

---

## üí° FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Low Priority)

### Additional Features
- [ ] **Add bulk import/export functionality** for student and IEP data
- [ ] **Implement automated IEP review reminders** and deadline tracking
- [ ] **Add progress tracking and goal mastery analytics** dashboard
- [ ] **Create parent/guardian portal** for IEP access and communication
